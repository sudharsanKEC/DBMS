Introduction to DBMS:
          1)The databases are almost used everywhere in this modern world such as universities,
organisations,Hospital and government agencies also rely on databases to store their datas.
          2)A database is a collection of interrelated datas.
          3)For example, A students information consists of his name,rollNo,address and mobile number.
          4)So those datas where stored in a database in a structured or unstructured manner
which should be easy to manage or manipulate those datas later.
          5)The primary objective of the database is to provide both convinient and efficient retrieval
of data.
          6) DBMS is designed to manage large bodes of information.
          7) In DBMS the safety of the information stored must be ensured despite of 
system crashes and attempts to unauthorized access.
