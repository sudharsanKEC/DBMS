       Adatabase system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs that allow
users to access and modify these data. A major purpose of a database system is to provide users
with an abstract view of the data.
       That is the system hides how data is stored and maintained.
The data models are classified into four different categories:
          1) Relational Model : 
                      The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data. 
          Each table has multiple columns,and each column is the atrribute and the rows of each column contains the different values. 
          Tables are also known as relations. The relational database model was the most widely used database model and a vast majority 
          current database systems are based on the relational mode.
          2) Entity relationship model :
